# Horse RIDEEEEER
🎯 The goal of this *very very simple* project is **forcing you to go faster like a Jockey!** *(That's why it's called Horse Rider)*
- ⏱️ Only thing you have to do is decide how many **questions** you'll solve in how many **minutes**!
- 🖥️ And the program basically calculates how much time you should spend per question *(ideally)*
- With that, you can **race against yourself** and try to go faster than the ideal time 😎

*"What will happen when the time's up?"* You should have guessed it by the title of the project.
